# Scaling_in_KNN
Hello, this is my first post in GitHub. 
This mini project is about modelling machine learning with KNN, and I will show you the difference between KNN model with and without scaling.
I use 'titanic' dataset with ['pclass', 'sex', 'age', 'fare'] as features and ['survived'] as my target variable.

The description are:

survived - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

pclass - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)survival - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

sex - (Female; Male)

age - age in number

fare - Passenger fare

The result show that with scaling our data, the model accuracy increase and of course, we also have to find the optimum 'k' value in KNN to increase our model accuracy.
